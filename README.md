# Airport analysis

The code in this repository processes and visualizes flight data collected by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the US Department of Transportation (DOT). That data can be accessed [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?QO_VQ=EEE&QO_anzr=Nv4%FDPn44vr4%FDf6n6v56vp5%FD%FLS14z%FDHE%FDg4nssvp%FM-%FDNyy%FDPn44vr45&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%FDPn44vr45).  

The original purpose of this repository was to compare the suitability of different airports for wastewater monitoring using criteria like number of long-distance flights and passengers. However, as Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) has become the strongest candidate for monitoring, an additional goal of this repository is to understand the flight and passenger dynamics at BOS in more detail.
